# Level Configuration

Unlike other rhythm games, Sonolus can play many different engines, so options such as note speed are in level configuration, rather than settings.

To access level configuration, first enter a level, and click "Configuration" button.

## Engine

In engine section, you can change the skin, background, SFX, and particle to use when playing.

You can not only select skins, backgrounds, SFX, and particles from the same custom server, but also from other custom servers and collections.

## Options

Options section contains options such as note speed.

Most options are shared across all levels of the same engine, so you don't have to change them every time.

## UI

UI section allows you to customize UI during gameplay.

You can change primary and secondary metric to metrics that you care about more. You can change judgment error style for better readability. You can change the style of various UI elements to make them more visible or less distracting.
