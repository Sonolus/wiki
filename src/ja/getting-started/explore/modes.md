# Modes

Levels have play, watch, preview, and tutorial mode.

## Play Mode

Exactly as you would expect, play the level and have fun!

## Watch Mode

You can watch the level on auto play like a video.

You can navigate around the level using the progress bar, and toggle the progress bar for precise control up to 1 millisecond increments.

While the UI is hidden, you can tap along the video to practice.

## Preview Mode

Preview mode shows a flat image representation of the level.

It's useful to get a quick overview of a level, or study patterns in a level.
