# Custom Servers

Custom servers are where online contents are shared in Sonolus.

Anyone can create and host their own custom servers, so there is no official list of all existing custom servers. Sonolus comes with three official servers you can play on right away.

## Contents

Custom servers can offer different contents, such as "Posts" where you can interact with other players, "Levels" where you can play solo, "Multiplayer" where you can play together with other players, "Replays" where you can watch other players' gameplay, and more.

After entering a custom server, different available contents are listed where you can explore.

## Adding Custom Servers

If you find a Sonolus custom server online and you would like to add, usually there is an "Open in Sonolus" button on their website and clicking the button should open the custom server in Sonolus. You can click "Save" in Sonolus to save the custom server for future visits.

Alternatively, you can click "Add" in Sonolus and paste the custom server URL to add it directly.
