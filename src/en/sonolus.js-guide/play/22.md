# 22 Options

In this chapter, we will add options to make our engine more versatile.

## Speed

One of the most used option in rhythm game is variable speed, it gives player the ability to speed up/slow down a level to make it more challenging/easier to practice with.

Let's add speed option to engine options:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export const optionsDefinition = {
    speed: {
        name: Text.Speed,
        standard: true,
        type: 'slider',
        def: 1,
        min: 0.5,
        max: 2,
        step: 0.05,
        unit: Text.PercentageUnit,
    },
} satisfies Record<string, EngineConfigurationOption>
```

```JavaScript
export const optionsDefinition = {
    speed: {
        name: Text.Speed,
        standard: true,
        type: 'slider',
        def: 1,
        min: 0.5,
        max: 2,
        step: 0.05,
        unit: Text.PercentageUnit,
    },
}
```

Amazingly, that's all we need to do. Sonolus knows about the special option name `NameText.LevelSpeed` and will automatically adjust the BGM speed to match, as well as all BPM values in BPM change. Because we have written our engine code entirely based on BPM and beats, it works without any further modification.

## Note Size

We may also offer a note size option, so that players can adjust it to their liking.

Let's add note size option to engine options:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export const optionsDefinition = {
    // ...
    noteSize: {
        name: Text.NoteSize,
        type: 'slider',
        def: 1,
        min: 0.1,
        max: 2,
        step: 0.05,
        unit: Text.PercentageUnit,
    },
} satisfies Record<string, EngineConfigurationOption>
```

```JavaScript
export const optionsDefinition = {
    // ...
    noteSize: {
        name: Text.NoteSize,
        type: 'slider',
        def: 1,
        min: 0.1,
        max: 2,
        step: 0.05,
        unit: Text.PercentageUnit,
    },
}
```

With that, let's use the value of note size option and adjust note radius:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export class Initialization extends Archetype {
    preprocess() {
        const noteRadius = 0.2 * options.noteSize
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

```JavaScript
export class Initialization extends Archetype {
    preprocess() {
        const noteRadius = 0.2 * options.noteSize
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```
