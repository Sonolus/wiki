# 04 Note and Panel Count

In this chapter, we will setup Note and implement calculating panel count.

## Note Archetype

Let's first set up Note:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export class Note extends Archetype {}
```

```JavaScript
export class Note extends Archetype {}
```

:::

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export const archetypes = defineArchetypes({
    // ...
    Note,
})
```

```JavaScript
export const archetypes = defineArchetypes({
    // ...
    Note,
})
```

:::

## Duration

If we know the duration, we can use it to calculate panel count.

How would we obtain the duration? A simple way is to have a variable storing the duration of a level, and update it as we visit notes.

Let's declare it, using Preview Data block:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export const chart = previewData({
    duration: Number,
})
```

```JavaScript
export const chart = previewData({
    duration: Number,
})
```

:::

## Updating Duration

To calculate note's time, we need its beat from data. We can declare it just like in play mode:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export class Note extends Archetype {
    import = this.defineImport({
        beat: { name: EngineArchetypeDataName.Beat, type: Number },
    })
}
```

```JavaScript
export class Note extends Archetype {
    import = this.defineImport({
        beat: { name: EngineArchetypeDataName.Beat, type: Number },
    })
}
```

:::

In Note's `preprocess` callback, we can update duration to note's time if it's bigger:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    preprocess() {
        chart.duration = Math.max(chart.duration, bpmChanges.at(this.import.beat).time)
    }
}
```

```JavaScript
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    preprocess() {
        chart.duration = Math.max(chart.duration, bpmChanges.at(this.import.beat).time)
    }
}
```

:::

## Panel Count

We can now change panel count to calculate based on the duration:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export const panel = {
    // ...

    get count() {
        return Math.ceil(chart.duration / this.h)
    },
}
```

```JavaScript
export const panel = {
    // ...

    get count() {
        return Math.ceil(chart.duration / this.h)
    },
}
```

:::

## Canvas

Last but not least, we need to make sure canvas size calculation code runs after all notes have finished updating duration.

We can move the code to Stage's `preprocess` and give it a higher order:

::: code-group

```TypeScript
export class Stage extends Archetype {
    preprocessOrder = 1
    preprocess() {
        canvas.set({
            scroll: Scroll.LeftToRight,
            size: (panel.count * panel.w * screen.h) / 20,
        })
    }

    // ...
}
```

```JavaScript
export class Stage extends Archetype {
    preprocessOrder = 1
    preprocess() {
        canvas.set({
            scroll: Scroll.LeftToRight,
            size: (panel.count * panel.w * screen.h) / 20,
        })
    }

    // ...
}
```
