# Collections

Collections allow you to save contents offline.

## Save to Collections

After you enter a level, you can click "Save" button to save it to a collection. Once saved, the level is now accessible offline.

Instead of trying to save everything to play offline, it is recommended that you simply play and have fun, and save as you go!

## Import and Export

Collections can be exported as `.scp` files, and imported back. You can save these files as a way to backup your collections or share them with friends.

To export a collection, enter the collection and click "Export" button.

To import a collection, click "Import" button.
