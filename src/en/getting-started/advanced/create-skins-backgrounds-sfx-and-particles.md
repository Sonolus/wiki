# Create Skins, Backgrounds, SFX, and Particles

You can create your own skins, backgrounds, SFX, and particles. Some custom servers allow sharing your created skins, backgrounds, SFX, and particles.

## Sonolus Studio

You can use [Sonolus Studio](https://studio.sonolus.com) to create your own skins, backgrounds, SFX, and particles.

However, it is difficult to create from scratch. Instead:

-   In Sonolus, create a collection.
-   Save a skin, background, SFX, or particle to the collection to use it as a base.
-   Export the collection.
-   In Sonolus Studio, open the exported collection `.scp` file.
-   Modify the base.
-   Save the project.
-   In Sonolus, import the project `.scp` file.

Your newly created skin, background, SFX, or particle is now available in Sonolus to use or be shared with others!
